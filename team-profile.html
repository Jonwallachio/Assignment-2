                    <h2>Team Profile: Test Outcomes and Interpretation</h2>
                    <p>The Myers-Briggs personality types of the Mighty Ducks are as follows:</p>
		    <ul>
	                <li>Alejandro: INFP-A (Mediator)</li>
		        <li>Bradley: INFP-T (Mediator)</li>
	                <li>Callum: INTP-A (Logician)</li>
		        <li>Jonathon: ENFJ-A (Protagonist)</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Alejandro and Callum did the Big Five personality test:</p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>Alejandro:</li>
		        <ul>
			    <li>O: 71%</li>
		            <li>C: 48%</li>
			    <li>E: 62.5%</li>
			    <li>A: 50%</li>
			    <li>N: 54%</li>
		        </ul>
		        <li>Callum:</li>
		        <ul>
			    <li>O: 77%</li>
			    <li>C: 48%</li>
			    <li>E: 8%</li>
			    <li>A: 54%</li>
			    <li>N: 42%</li>
		        </ul>
		    </ul>
                    <p>Alejandro and Bradley did a learning style test at educationplanner.org:</p>
                    <ul>
		        <li>Alejandro:</li>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Auditory: 35%</li>
			    <li>Visual: 25%</li>
			    <li>Tactile: 40%</li>
	                </ul>
		        <li>Bradley:</li>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Auditory: 30%</li>
			    <li>Visual: 25%</li>
			    <li>Tactile: 45%</li>
	                </ul>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Callum and Jonathon took similar learning style tests, but at different
		      websites:
		    </p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>Callum: VARK Questionnaire</li>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Visual: 11</li>
			    <li>Aural: 4</li>
			    <li>Read/write: 9</li>
			    <li>Kinesthetic: 13</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Jonathon: Personality Max Learning Style</li>
			<ul>
			    <li>Auditory: 77</li>
			    <li>Visual: 74</li>
			    <li>Kinesthetic: 69</li>
			</ul>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Jonathon did a creativity quiz at mindtools.com and scored 59-80, which told
		      him that creativity is one of his strengths. Bradley also did a creativity
		      quiz at psychologies.co.uk, which told him that creativity, for him, is a way
		      to express himself and a way to release his emotions.
		    </p>
		    <p>Three out of four members of the team are introverts, according to the Myers-
		      Briggs personality test. This may seem like bad news in a social environment
		      but it’s common knowledge that introverts get along with introverts. There’s a
		      good chance that the introverts of the team will get along well enough to be
		      able to let their ideas and thoughts be expressed in a productive manner.
		      Jonathon could fit well into this equation too though; extroverts generally
		      tend to excel in team environments. According to the theories of MBTI
		      dynamics, Jonathon may be a very valuable and productive member of the team,
		      not just in the IT work that he does to fulfill criteria, but in his ability
		      to help coordinate and organise team efforts.
