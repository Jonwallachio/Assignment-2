					<h2> Project Aim</h2>
                    <p>The project is a calendar application which aims to provide users with busy lifestyles with a tool that can assist them with time management and create some balance in the different responsibilities (work, school hobbies, fitness etc) they have in their daily lives. This is achieved through utilising some or all of the many features provided by the application.</p>
					<h2>Calendar</h2>
                  	<p>The goal is to have a calendar is to assist the user with their time management. The calendar service within the application provides the user with a comprehensive service to schedule activities, block out times when they are unavailable and schedule any appointments they may have. It can set reminders and alarms for the user using push and pull notifications and has an easy to navigate interface. The calendar is an essential part of the application as it makes up the barebones of it.
During development of the calendar it is important that all the other features of the application can be integrated into the calendar seamlessly and all permissions are given and accessible by the application
</p>
					<h2>Automation</h2>
					<p>The goal of the automation function in the application is to provide the user with smart suggestions to add into their schedule / calendar. It does this by collecting data about times and locations for previous regular or semi-regular meetings and suggesting an appropriate time and place for scheduling future meetings. This can help greatly with improving and encouraging good time management skills. The automation feature could make suggestions based on previous schedules and data entered manually by the user, but it could also benefit from using location services so it can make suggestions when the user is in that area, or send reminders about a meeting starting time etc. Using location services would require access to location permissions from the user’s phone and the developers would have to make sure this information is kept secure should the user give the application access to this information. The user would of course be given the option to opt out of giving location permissions.</p>
					<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
					<p>The goal of the natural language processing is to assist the user by interpreting the content of new meetings and suggesting attendees to invite, locations to have the meeting and times for the meeting based on previous schedules. It can also assist the user should they type a date such as “next Tuesday” or “next month” by navigating to that part of the calendar. This improves the ease of use of the application as well as time management. Similar to the automation feature this feature would be able to make predictions based on previous data entered into the application, it also would require access to permissions such as or similar to auto-fill in order to be able to make suggestions to the user.</p>
					<h2>Integration with other applications</h2>
					<p>The goal of integrating with other applications on the user’s phone is to allow for seamless navigation between different tools and simplify the user experience. This allows the user to schedule or create a meeting for example and send invites to other users in the relevant application. Integrating with other applications in this way creates a seamless and user-friendly environment that anybody can use. This would require the app to be able to gain permissions again in order to access information and launch other applications within its own interface. This could be a lengthy process and difficult goal depending on which and how many applications you want to have compatible with the Calendar, however it could also something that the developers could work on continually updating post release, improving compatibility with newer and trending apps and ensuring they get the appropriate permissions from other developers.</p>
					<h2>Data-based reports</h2>
					<p>The goal of the data-based reports is to let the user see how they are using time and maybe encourage better time management. By highlighting to the user how much time they spend on their phone, in meetings, exercising etc it can encourage the user to make smarter decisions about their time management. This is an important aim of the application as it has such a strong focus on its purpose. A detailed report would be made based on data given to the application from it’s other features and presented to the user highlighting things such as what they spent the most time doing, what they need to spend more time doing etc. This is all data that would be collected from the other features listed and should be a fairly straight-forward process to develop. </p>
					<h2>Mindfulness</h2>
					<p>The goal of the mindfulness feature is to learn when the user may be stressed or have a heavy workload. The application utilizes data driven machine learning to understand the users schedule and can suggest blocks of time to devote to mindfulness activities such as meditation or exercise. The application can also suggest to the user when they might need a break from laborious tasks such as study.  This feature can be very beneficial to the user’s mental health and wellbeing. Using the data collected and previous data based resorts, it will need to be able to identify both busy moments when the user might need to take a five minute break, and any upcoming downtime where the user could fit in some meditation, exercise or other mindful activity.</p>
					<h2>Exercise Support</h2>
					<p>The exercise support app’s goal is to schedule regular time blocks for exercise into the user’s calendar. It can utilise the phones inbuild pedometer function in order to suggest the type, length and location of future exercise sessions. People with busy lifestyles often don’t get enough exercise so this feature can be very beneficial to a person’s physical and mental well-being. By identifying 30–60-minute blocks and scheduling an exercise session to the user it can create a fitness schedule or routine for the user which would encourage them to stay active. This feature would need to be able to identify any down time in the application which is suitable for a workout and even identify what workout the user has done in the previous day(s) in order to suggest to the user what type of exercise they should do.</p>
