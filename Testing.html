<h3>Test plan</h3> 
<p>The project team will oversee a variety of testing approaches to arrive at a function working application.</p>
<p>1. The first key plank of the test approach will be to implement Unit Testing on all deployed code before it is considered ready for development. This will mean appointing one of the porject team as a dedicated tester.</p>
<p>2. The second part of the testing framework will be the implmentation of User Acceptance Testing. Tester will ideally be prospective user's of the application. They will be asked to follow a set of pre-determined test scenarios to test each aspect of the application's functonality via the user interface.</p>
<p>3. The third aspect of testing will consist of post-implementation verification testing. This will require the same set of user testers to make sure the application is functioning appropriatley by running the set of relevant pre-determined test scenarios after the code is relesed into production</p>
<p>4. To support these tests, a set of automated test scenarios will be developed and run on a periodic basis. This will support unit testing in particular</p>
