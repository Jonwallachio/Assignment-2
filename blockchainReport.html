                    <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
                    <p>A blockchain is a type of database, a collection of data which is stored and then 
                        structured in a format that allows for easier searching, processing and filtering. 
                        What sets apart a blockchain from your everyday database is that rather than simply 
                        storing the data in a table the blockchain collects information in groups and forms 
                        it into a <i>block</i> which can be thought of as a set that holds data. Due to storage limitations 
                        when enough data has been grouped to form a block that block will then become ‘locked’ 
                        and a new block will begin production to form a chain. <i>Blockchain.</i> When implemented in a 
                        decentralised manner this makes each completed block not only immutable, but completely 
                        transparent. Each block is timestamped and the chain itself functions as a sort of timeline.
                        <br><br>
                        Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency or <i>coin.</i> 
                        For many people blockchain and bitcoin are synonymous, usually referring to any cryptocurrency 
                        as bitcoin or internet money. With blockchains key qualities of immutability and transparency, 
                        this has led to the main use case of this technology as a ledger, a collection of financial 
                        transactions. Unlike a typical database, centralised, a blockchain isn’t generally affected by 
                        DoS attacks, environmental catastrophes, machine failures, or even a legislative ban from an 
                        entire country. If a standard database will use a large amount of computers in a centralised location, 
                        a blockchain will typically store the database across many locations and many computers, hundreds of 
                        thousands even. This decentralised approach can translate each computer and network location as a <i>node</i>.
                        <br><br>
                        In a blockchain, each and every node has a full copy of the blockchain, and each node works to validate the 
                        previous blocks and ensure continuous block production. If one user tries to alter the existing blockchain 
                        the rest of the nodes will work through the data and invalidate altered blocks and stop or <i>fork</i> the chain. 
                        In order to change the blockchain a majority of the decentralised nodes will need to agree with the changed 
                        data, then the chain can continue. If a user forks the chain with altered data it basically renders it useless, 
                        as no one else will be contributing to that chain and there’ll be no value within. However hard forks have 
                        occured before, see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic' target ='_blank'>Ethereum VS Ethereum Classic</a>, 
                        a case where the minority of miners or nodes stayed with the altered chain and kept enough momentum to continue 
                        production, albeit as another blockchain altogether.
                        <br><br>
                        Due to the decentralised nature of Bitcoin, and most blockchain projects, anyone can view the transactions 
                        that were made on the chain. They can see what address it came from, when it was made and the fiat and crypto 
                        nominal value. This implementation also creates greater security than a conventional centralised approach, 
                        blocks are always added chronologically and its very difficult to alter past blocks, doing so would generally 
                        result in the other nodes cross checking and discarding your nodes chain as illegitimate. In fact if any 
                        minute piece of data is changed at all then the <i>hash code</i> (a sort of signature of the block) will change as 
                        well, flagging it for illegitimacy. Say someone wants to alter the blockchain and give themselves a bunch 
                        of the native currency, other nodes will cross check this and the alteration will have been fruitless, this 
                        ensures that someone can’t steal someone elses holdings by just editing the chain. In a truly decentralised 
                        blockchain the only way to really attack the network is with whats called a <i>51% attack</i>. 
                        <br><br>
                        Succeeding with a hack like a 51% attack would require immense wealth and computing power. The hacker would need 
                        to effectively hijack 51% of the nodes and alter the chain so that consensus can be reached and the nodes accept 
                        the new chain. Due to the treatment of crypto as an extremely volatile investment vehicle, the more fiat value the 
                        chain acquires the more expensive it is to overtake the majority of nodes, as more miners flock to contribute to 
                        nodes more processing power will also be needed to control the increase in nodes. Keep in mind, even if the hacker 
                        can successfully alter the chain due to the transparent nature everyone would notice and value and trust would 
                        quickly be lost in the project. Many blockchain projects have collapsed under the weight of a 51% attack, as miners 
                        move their resources to a different project after noticing the hack, or existing nodes forking to another version 
                        of the chain and not keeping momentum with resources or development.
                        <br><br>
                        Still we must ask ourselves, <strong><i>where is the inherent value in the blockchain and its native cryptocurrencies?</i></strong> Is it 
                        simply a digital ledger? What use cases exist that can create value in the real world? Companies like Pfizer, 
                        Walmart and Unilever use blockchain technology to trace product routes and verify product authenticity, but projects 
                        like VET (VeThorChain trading at $0.16) which are built and utilised for this specific purpose aren’t as big in 
                        market cap as Bitcoin or Etheruem, $65k and $4k respectively as of October 2021. One could argue that the value 
                        in cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin, is its transparent and immutable qualities that appeal to individuals 
                        who desire an investment or currency that cannot be easily manipulated or hidden. The technology of blockchain 
                        provides for trustless authentication, digital identities, peer to peer energy, peer to peer network hosting 
                        and countless decentralised applications.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps the industry which stands to be the most impacted by this technology is the financial sector, what crypto enthusiasts 
                        are beginning to refer to as tradfi (traditional finance) due to the emergence of DeFi (decentralised finance). DeFi has 
                        allowed for a much more appealing alternative to banks, the money you can keep in your savings account might net you 0.5% 
                        interest a year at best, while <i>staking</i> - contributing to coin governance, security and block production - functions the same 
                        as a savings account but can safely net you anywhere from 4% - 10% interest per annum. Today you can even take loans out 
                        against your crypto as collateral.
                        <br><br>
                        Blockchains have inbuilt currencies referred to as coins, these coins are distributed as a reward for the node that completes 
                        a block, the coins are then given a fiat value as dictated by normal market mechanics. Nodes can be made up of one owner 
                        running several machines to try complete blocks or nowadays by individuals who will pool their resources together to a node and 
                        then split the reward. The appeal in this is that the value of your currency isn’t at the whims of a central authority and not 
                        subject to the same inflation or deflation mechanics. Coins can be inflationary or deflationary, but as a core design choice 
                        of the protocol rather than the musings of governments. Without the need for a central authority, transactions can be processed 
                        whenever rather than on banking days and hours, this does however result in transaction fees being imposed on the user. 
                        This is generally acceptable by users and the only real negative impact of cryptocurrencies is the environmental effect mining 
                        (using an enormous amount of computing power) can have, this is being quickly negated however as chains turn to proof of stake 
                        rather than proof of work, with many chains aiming to be carbon neutral or negative.
                        <br><br>
                        Holding your funds in a blockchain can prove to be significantly more lucrative than a traditional savings account, and the chain 
                        will never tell you where you can spend your money or control your deposits/withdrawals. This creates a terrifying worst case 
                        scenario for banks who are at the risk of becoming obsolete, however big banks generally aren’t stupid and have been accumulating 
                        mass amounts of cryptocurrency in order to hedge themselves as well as control large sectors of big blockchain projects, 
                        this helps them centralise and consolidate their power as well as create significant influence on governance which is becoming 
                        a more common feature amongst blockchains.
                        <br><br>
                        Huge innovations have been made since the beginning of bitcoin and blockchains, some of the recent more substantial improvements 
                        have been non fungible tokens, smart contracts and proof of stake.
                        <br><br>
                        What impacts your daily life is the effect cryptocurrency can have on the greater market, as at 10th October 2021 the entire 
                        crypto market is valued at 3.2 trillion AUD, almost 3 times the value of Australia’s entire GDP. With institutions beginning to 
                        pile in, significant crashes can start to affect more than just overleveraged individual investors. The main reason mass 
                        adoption hasn’t occurred yet in my opinion is the barrier of access to cryptocurrencies, it’s not exactly as easy to use as cash 
                        or a bank card, storing and being in complete control of your funds also keeps the onus for security on the owner and investors 
                        have been subject to many rugpulls, hacks and scams over the years.
                        <br><br>
                        Interestingly enough, in September 2021 the President of El Salvador has declared Bitcoin legal tender and has spent much of the 
                        countries money on acquiring the asset. The law has resulted in the requirement that businesses must accept Bitcoin if offered 
                        and many citizens downloading the governments <i>Chivo wallet</i> in order to hold and spend bitcoin. To incentivise adoption, the 
                        government of El Salvador even offered its citizens who downloaded the Chivo wallet $30USD in Bitcoin. El Salvador, like its cousin 
                        Venezuela is another country which is subject to the US Dollar, its centralised bank and severe inflation. As this is a recent 
                        development and first step toward mass adoption, time will tell what this event will do the country citizens and financial health.
