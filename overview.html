                    <h2>Overview section</h2>
<p>





<h3>Overview</h3> 
<p>Our project is centred around the implementation of a new Work/Life balance application. The app will be targeted primarily at phone users, but will be expanded to be both tablet and PC compatible.</p>
<p>The goal of our project team will be to commence the application with the fundamental building blocks. We will treat the following two features as our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Following implementation of these initial features we will seek customer feedback and implement features based on the appetite and interest shown towards the prospective, iterative features we plan to deliver.</p>



<h3>Feature 1: Calendar service</h3> 
<p>A detailed, comprehensive calendar service, with the ability to schedule activities, block out time and track commitments. The calendar feature will allow users to schedule appointments, commitments and blocks of time to devote to activities. These periods of time will incorporate alarms and notifications services, both push and pull and will incorporate modern UX designs to allow users to navigate easily between options.</p>



<h3>Feature 2: Data based reports supplied on a regular basis</h3> 
<p>The application will utilize the historical data available to it and produce regular reports highlighting the user's activities and time management. This will include details such as how much time the user spent on the phone, sending or reading emails, in meetings or appointments, exercising or pursuing fitness goals, at work, with family, in social activities and more. This reporting will enable the user to make smarter decisions about future time management.</p>



<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation for the Work/Life Balance app is very practical and relatable – we seek to help people navigate the many responsibilities and time constraints they face in their day to day lives. The idea behind the application is to provide support to working people who need to juggle their time between the many and varied activities and obligations that make up life. From work to exercise, family to social life, study to health, the app seeks to help people manage, plan and execute on their daily tasks.</p>
<p>The application speaks to our project team, as all of us are juggling these obligations and responsibilities in our own lives. An app such as the one we seek to build would be useful to all of us.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>There are many applications in the marketplace that seek to do part of what our application proposes to do. There are calendar services, exercise apps, diet apps, apps to help with mindfulness, and myriad others. What is lacking is one application that synthesizes and utilises all the data from various inputs to create a single, universal approach to time management and support. The marketplace has also done very little to take advantage of new trends in automation and natural language processing to improve and help simplify the decision making process associated with allocating time to end user’s responsibilities. There’s so much more an application of this nature could do beyond basic time keeping and the like.</p>
