<h3>Group reflections questions</h3> 
<h4>Jonathon Wallace</h4>

<ul>
                        <li>What went well: The team had a difficult path on this project, but the guys really pulled together at the last minute in trying circumstances. I was really pleased with the way the guys scrambled to handle things and produced all required assignment components in the end</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: I personally faced some difficult personal circumstances, involving the health of family members. This made things challenging from the perspective of contributing to the team and project</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: I was impressed at how well the team got on with things. Everyone focusssed on their strengths and was able to contribute what they could.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: The group was fairly well self-organising, despite challenges with personal cricumstances, covid preventing real world collaboration and a variety of other challengees</li>                      

                        </ul>
                        <br><br>


<h4>Bradley Kurzke</h4>
<ul>
                        <li>What went well: It seemed at some point each member of the group had been hit with some kind of misfortune or setback (This week was my turn it seems as I lacerated my finger at work, requiring plastic surgery). But through determination we were able to submit both assignment 3 and 5.</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: Of course In an ideal world, real life situations wouldn’t get in the way and prevent us from getting the work submitted in a timelier matter, could we have an extra few weeks?</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: There was one point during the project where I’m sure all of us felt the wheels were about to fall off and the project would be impossible to complete, how we got from there to submitting a complete project plan and video is a huge achievement.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: Group work is something I loathed during my school years and I was surprised how strong a focus was put on it during this course. In the workplace I often have to work together with others but I have always preferred to work alone. This experience has taught me that with a motivated team you can get a lot more done.</li>
