<h2>Group reflections questions</h2> 
<h4>Jonathon Wallace</h4>

<ul>
                        <li>What went well: The team had a difficult path on this project, but the guys really pulled together at the last minute in trying circumstances. I was really pleased with the way the guys scrambled to handle things and produced all required assignment components in the end</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: I personally faced some difficult personal circumstances, involving the health of family members. This made things challenging from the perspective of contributing to the team and project</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: I was impressed at how well the team got on with things. Everyone focusssed on their strengths and was able to contribute what they could.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: The group was fairly well self-organising, despite challenges with personal cricumstances, covid preventing real world collaboration and a variety of other challengees</li>                      

                        </ul>
                        <br><br>


<h4>Bradley Kurzke</h4>
<ul>
                        <li>What went well: It seemed at some point each member of the group had been hit with some kind of misfortune or setback (This week was my turn it seems as I lacerated my finger at work, requiring plastic surgery). But through determination we were able to submit both assignment 3 and 5.</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: Of course In an ideal world, real life situations wouldn’t get in the way and prevent us from getting the work submitted in a timelier matter, could we have an extra few weeks?</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: There was one point during the project where I’m sure all of us felt the wheels were about to fall off and the project would be impossible to complete, how we got from there to submitting a complete project plan and video is a huge achievement.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: Group work is something I loathed during my school years and I was surprised how strong a focus was put on it during this course. In the workplace I often have to work together with others but I have always preferred to work alone. This experience has taught me that with a motivated team you can get a lot more done.</li>                      

                        </ul>
                        <br><br>

<h4>Callum Copely</h4>
<ul>
                        <li>What went well: We collaborated and finished the assignment despite all of the drawbacks. There were hardly any conflict of interests and we all did what was needed to be done.</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: Well, I could've chosen to move houses at a different time. The misfortunes that the rest of the team endured, though, was out of their control.</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: We actually finished the assignment in entirety. Often times it seemed like so many setbacks were happening for all of us that we would end up with a half-baked project, but that doesn't seem to be the case.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: I have virtually no experience with group projects whatsoever, and therefore have always worked alone. I used to imagine that teams would be an annoying thing to work with, but from working in this team I've learned that it can be the best way to get things done if everyone has their heads screwed on right.</li>                      

                        </ul>
                        <br><br>

<h4>Alejandro Conejo</h4>
<ul>
                        <li>What went well: Worked well with others. Learned a lot of geat things.</li>

                        <li>What could be improved: Less external pressure on the team would have helped. Better organisation at times.</li>

                        <li>One surprising thing: How we all came together in the end.</li>

                        <li>Group learnings: Its tough working in groups, but we made it work.</li>                      

                        </ul>
