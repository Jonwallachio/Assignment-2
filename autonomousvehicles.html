                    <h2>IT Industries - Autonomous Vehicles                  </h2>
					<p>By Bradley Kurzke
					  <br>
					  S3925834@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
                  <h3>What is an autonomous vehicle?</h3>
					<p>An autonomous vehicle is, simply put a self – driving car. While the technology sounds so modern and futuristic, the idea has been around for a long time. At the 1939 new world’s fair, General Motors showcased their vision for an automated highway system, which guided vehicles with radio controlled magnetic fields. And by 1958 General Motors had turned their vision into a reality. The car had sensors in its front-end which could detect a current flowing through a wire embedded in the road. The current could be manipulated to tell the vehicle which way to turn.  These days the technology is much more advanced, and much safer for the user.<br>
					In autonomous driving there are considered to be 6 levels of autonomy:
				  <ul>
					 <li>0.	No driving automation – the user is in complete control of the vehicle</li> 
					 <li>1.	Driver assistance - features such as cruise control or park assist would fall in this category</li> 
					  <li>2.	Partial driver automation – more advanced driver assistance systems, where the vehicle can control acceleration, steering and braking simultaneously</li>
					  <li>3.	Conditional automation – the vehicle can drive itself in some situations, allowing the driver to take their eyes off the road.</li>
					  <li>4.	High automation - the vehicle can drive completely on its own within certain conditions, the driver can however take over and drive manually if needed.</li>
					  <li>5.	Full automation – the vehicle can monitor and maneuver through any road conditions with no human interaction. This vehicle doesn’t need a steering wheel or accelerator.</li></ul>  
				  <p>Whilst level 5 autonomy is yet to be achieved, level 4 autonomy is closer than we think. In fact, if you are in Phoenix, Arizona you can already catch a ride in Googles <a href="https://waymo.com/" target='_blank'>Waymo</a> – a level 4 autonomous vehicle. Competitors such as Hyundai’s <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/au/en/cars/eco/ioniq5">IONIQ 5 </a>robotaxi are also not far off launching their own Level 4 commuter services. It is entirely plausible to suggest that in the not-too-distant future there will be Autonomous taxi or bus services in most major cities in the world. </p>
					  <p>The technology used in autonomous vehicles is very interesting, lets use the RAC’s <a href="https://rac.com.au/about-rac/advocating-change/initiatives/automated-vehicle-program/intellibus" target='_blank'>Intellibus </a>trial in Perth as an example:<br>
					    The Intellibus uses Lidar, GPS and odometry technology to drive by itself, the front of the Vehicle is equipped with 2d Lidar which is used to detect and avoid objects which are in front of it, and two cameras which can record anything in front of the vehicle and analyze the roads infrastructure. The two cameras also provide the vehicle with depth perception, much like a pair of eyes to determine the distance of an object in front of the vehicle. There is also a 3D Lidar device on top of the vehicle which creates a 3d map of its surroundings with a viewing distance of up to 500 metres. This helps the vehicle to track and detect any obstacles movement and can determine their distance from the vehicle. 
					  
					      <br>
			          For GPS and navigating, the Intellibus uses a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS, which can provide position accuracy within 2cm. it achieves this by communicating with as many satellites as possible as well as a base receiver. The base receiver takes all the measurements from the satellites as well as its own location and sends the data back to the vehicle. Providing the vehicle with an accurate estimation of its location relative to the base receiver. An odometry sensor is also equipped in order to estimate the vehicles position and orientation based on its starting point. This is measured in centimeters.				</p>
				  <h3>What impact can autonomous vehicles have on our society?</h3>
				<p>The impact  of autonomous vehicles on society could be huge. Here are just some examples of  the benefits of autonomous vehicles:<ul><li>Safer roads  - The vast majority of vehicle accidents are caused by human error, so road  safety would improve significantly.</li>
				  <li>Reduced  carbon emissions – Electrified light duty vehicles and eco-friendly driving  that saves fuel could reduce exhaust pipe emissions. A computerized GPS system  is also able to choose a more fuel-efficient route</li>
				  <li>Less  congestion – it sounds crazy, but driverless vehicles could potentially  communicate with each other and control traffic, creating smaller clusters and  improving traffic flow in congested areas.</li>
				  <li>A safer  environment for women and the vulnerable – with all the stories and statistics  you hear about assaults by drivers in ride share services, an autonomous  vehicle without a driver should make women and vulnerable people feel a lot  safer whilst commuting.</li></ul>
				  There are  however, a few disadvantages too: <ul>
				  <li>Data  protection and hacking issues – autonomoles are vulnerable to hackers,  who could potentially gain access to peoples private or banking information or  even potentially gain control of the vehicles themselves.</li>
				  <li>Cost of the  infrastructure – Whilst all the roads are already available and built,  Autonomous vehicles do rely on 5g technology - which is expensive and not yet  widespread. This also limits where the vehicles can be used.</li>
				  <li>Cost of the  vehicles – Whilst the manufacturing costs of these vehicles will eventually  drop, at the moment the technology is outside of the majority of the  populations price range.</li>
				  <li>Loss of  jobs – Whilst there has and will be further increase in engineering work  available as a result of an increase in automated vehicles, those working in  ride sharing positions will be at risk of losing their jobs</li>
				  </ul>
				  </p>
				  Whilst the introduction of autonomous vehicles can potentially lead to a much safer environment for us all, there is clearly some economic and security issues that need to be addressed should they become commonplace.
			<h3>How will this affect me?</h3>
			<p>The concept of an autonomous vehicle is both fascinating and potentially world changing, but how much of an impact will it have on our daily lives?</p>
			<p>Not all people can rely on public transport in their daily commute, that is why we have so much traffic on the roads now. Whilst autonomous bus and taxi services will help to improve congestion and efficiency of public transport, the cost of a personal vehicle with level 4 autonomy will be out of the average commuters price bracket. So what effect will it have on the average commuter if they can't afford the technology?</p><ul><li>Cities will implement new infrastructure when designing roads - in order for autonomous vehicles to become commonplace, our roads and intersections will have to be brought up to a standard that benefits autonomous vehicles. this could also include higher capacity mobile networks and radio transmitters at intersections in order to communicate with vehicles. The average commuter will benefit from improved infrastructure as it means safer roads and potentially better commuting times</li>
			<li>Decrease in human error - The more autonomous vehicles we have on the road the lesser the margin of human error which is a <a href="https://www.nrspp.org.au/resources/human-error-in-road-accidents/">contributing factor in over 90% of all road incidents</a>. Less distracted and inebriated drivers on the road means a much safer environment for us all.</li>
			<li>Less vehicle costs - safer roads means less medical bills, repair bills, and potentially even lower insurance costs.</li>
			<li>Greater independence for seniors and disabled - the elderly or people with physical or mental disabilities will have more freedoms and independence when it comes to commuting, and will require less dependance on their carers.</li>
			<li>A better environment for everybody - less traffic jams and a potential increase in demand for electric vehicles makes a cleaner and greener environment for us all to enjoy</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			Autonomous vehicles are breaking new ground in the auto industry. They will make a safer world for us all, but it does come at a cost. as an IT industry it creates huge demand for security, data protection, engineering and infrastructure. However,  unskilled workers who rely on providing ride share services may be severely affected.
