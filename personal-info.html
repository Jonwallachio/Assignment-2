		    <h2>Bradley Kurzke</h2>
		    <p>I am a 35 year old Australian who has worked as a storeperson for the past 15
		      years. I was born in Victoria, have lived in Tasmania for 11 of my adult years
		      and recently moved to Perth with my partner. I have an interest in music and
		      play guitar. I used to play in a punk rock band in Tasmania however that ended
		      once covid happened. Since selling everything and moving to perth I have found
		      myself with a lot of extra spare time, so I have decided to explore one of my
		      other hobbies which is computers and IT.

		    <h2>Callum Copley</h2>
		    <p>I am a 21-year-old Australian from NSW, and most of my work so far has
		      consisted of labouring, mainly concreting. I have used many computers
		      throughout my life, and generally I was always good at using and navigating
		      them, but I had never actually owned a computer for myself until 2018, when I
		      built my first PC. Initially I had Windows installed on it, but having my own
		      computer allowed me to begin improving my computational skills to an unlimited
		      potential and it wasnâ€™t long before I was delving into the world of software
		      and teaching myself about Linux, programming, etc. In particular, I am
		      passionate about the idea of free and open-source software. If I had to pick
		      only one hobby that I had to do for the rest of my life, it would be tinkering
		      with computers and software. Anoher big hobby of mine is gardening.

		    <h2>Jonathon Wallace</h2>
		    <p>I live in the Inner West of Sydney. I am married with one son, a six year old
		      boy. I have a bachelor's degree but I am returning to university study after 
                      many years and trying to balance that with full time work. I am a joint US/
                      Australian citizen and I enjoy a number of different hobbies, including going 
                      to the gym, watching lots of different sports, reading and playing the 
                      occasional video game. I have been employed in IT for approximately 7 years as
                      a product owner, business analyst and scrum master. I now work in 
                      telecommunications. My roles have not involved software development directly, 
                      and I have undertaken this course at RMIT to help enable me to 
                      learn how to become a software developer. I became interested in IT from my 
                      workplace experiences. I began on working various projects that involved IT 
                      and became more and more fascinated. I made it a career goal to become 
                      involved. I have scrum mastered for large teams of developers and been 
                      involved in virtually every step of the process of software development, 
                      except for the actual software development itself. My commencing this degree 
                      is an attempt to close that gap. I hope to slowly build up my ability to more 
                      directly involve my self in the software development cycle. I expect to remain
                      as a Scrum Master, though who knows where the future will take me. Maybe at 
                      the end of my degree I'll move into software development itself.
