                  <h3>Education</h3>
                  <p>The education for all 4 positions varies significantly. </p><ul>
                    <li>As a lead game developer, Alejandro requires relevant game design and computer engineering / science degree/s</li>
                    <li>As a penetration tester, Callum requires IT and computer Science degree/s</li>
                    <li>As an agile coach, Jonathan would benefit from a bachelor in IT,  and also requires  scrum master, SAFe scrum master and Scaled Agilist certificates</li>
                    <li>As an IT support officer, Bradley requires a Diploma or Bachelor in IT                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  Alejandro and Callum both require some computer science training, Jonathan requires some unique skill based certifications, and everybody will benefit from an IT degree.</p>
					<h3>Experience Required					</h3>
					<p>There are some shared experience requirements within these occupations.</p>
				<ul>	<li>Alejandro and Callum both require a good knowledge of programming languages</li>
						<li>Callum and Bradley both require OS knowledge and experience with network OS</li></ul>
				  <h3>Key Skills</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Communication skills are essential for Alejandro, Jonathan and Bradley's positions</li>
					  <li>Alejandro and Callum both need computer language skills</li>
					</ul>
					<p>the key skills for each position vary and some are unique to that specific position. for example Jonathan's agile coach position relies heavily on knowledge of its own software and systems.</p>
				<h3>Median Salary</h3>
                  <p>The median salary for each position varies significantly however there are two considerable differences</p><ul><li>Alejandro's position as Lead game developer is indeterminable as it is dependant on many variants, this is the nature of the gaming industry.</li>
                    <li>Jonathans position as Agile coach is generally via contract and therefore doesn't have a specific annual salary</li> </ul> 
				<h3>Demand in IT Industry</h3>
                 
                  </p>All but Alejandro's position as Lead game developer are currently in High demand within the IT industry.  the main factor in this is that game development is within the creative side of the IT industry, and whilst we all love video games the sad fact is they aren't an essential aspect of our everyday lives.
