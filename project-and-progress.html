<h3>Project Overview</h3> 
<p>The Work Life Balance application began as an attempt to imagine a product that could provide genuine, realistic support and help for busy working people.</p>
<p>As we approached this work, we began with an initial concept, with a small number of key user features, tailored to our target market.</p>
<p>We then engaged in a long process of refinement to arrive at a final list of user features, a minimum viable product with which to begin development and customer feedback, and a project plan to progress the application forward.</p>
