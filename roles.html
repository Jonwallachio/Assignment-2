                    <h2>Roles</h2>
<p>
<p>The assignment of roles for each of the team members was not needed, as each of us did not stick
  to only one area of expertise. However, Alejandro single-handedly programmed the WorkLife app,
  which consists mainly of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Therefore if we were to assign roles,
  it would be fair to title Alejandro as User Interface Designer, or Lead Developer. Other than
  Alejandro, we were all assigned tasks that could not be easily categorised into roles.<p>
