                  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
		  <p>
                    <h3>Software Tools</h3>
		    
	            <li>GNU Emacs</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Callum has at least a year of experience with editing text in Emacs, and
			it is his text editor of choice. In this project, Callum uses Emacs for
			writing and running/testing python code, as well as writing HTML.</li>
		    </ul>
		    
		    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>VSCode is Alejandro’s text editor of choice, which he uses for writing and
			running/testing python code. He did not have any experience with VSCode
			prior to starting these courses, however it was very easy to learn and
			intuitively designed. The fact that Microsoft owns both VSC and GitHub makes
			for a smooth experience between writing code, debugging, launching virtual
			environments and version control with GitHub. VSC also has a lot of plugins
			available that make things easier or more intuitive on the writing and
			testing side of things.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <li>Tkinter</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Tkinter is an interface allowing Python to utilise the Tk python library,
			and was used in the pygui project. Alejandro had no previous experience
			creating GUIs hence it’s a pretty small program, however learning Python in
			the programming course made for a much smoother transition to the
			wrapper.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h3>Online Tools & Services</h3>
		    
		    <li>GitHub</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>The team uses GitHub for file sharing, team work, and the creation of
			this website. None of the team has had prior experience with Github.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>The team uses MS Teams for meetings and group messages concerning the
			assignments. None of the team has had prior experience with Teams.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h3>License</h3>

		    <li>Apache v2.0</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Apache license was chosen to be used for the pygui GitHub repo due to it
			being easy to import through GitHub’s website, and it also allows the code
			to be copied, modified and distributed as open source. Additionally, all
			copies of the files, modified and unmodified, are accompanied by a copy of
			the license, which enables easy collaboration on the project.</li>
		    </ul>
