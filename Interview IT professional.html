                    <h2><u>Wen Yeow - DevOps Professional</u></h2><br><br>
<h3>What does an IT professional do in a day at work?</h3>
<p>Jonathon: Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</p> 
<p>Wen: I write software that helps speed up software developer workflow. Software developers write code, and you want to compile your code. You want to deploy your code and test your code. 
   So I write the code or automation that makes this go faster. I write the automation that makes this go faster.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Another term for this might be the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>Wen: That's a generic term for it yeah.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Or just Devops.</p>
<p>Wen: Devops, yes. Or just provider of software if you want to keep it simple.</p>
<h3>What industry does Wen work in?</h3>
<p>Jonathon: Please tell us about the industry you work in?</p> 
<p>Wen: I usually work in the financial services industry - right now with ASX. Previously at NAB/MLC. So banks, financial services. That's my industry.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Yes, that's where we met. Did you fall into that, or was it planned?</p>
<p>Wen: That's a great question. I don't know why, but somehow I always ended up in the financial industry. Previously I worked in insurance.</p> 
<p>Jonathon: Was this mostly an accident of circumstance?</p>
<p>Wen: Well, the people that manage money usually have money. There's a lot of work.</p>
<h3>What other work does an IT professional do?</h3>
<p>Jonathon: What other kinds of work do you have to do?</p> 
<p>Wen: So on a day-to-day basis i write code. Reach a certain level in in terms of seniority or your knowledge level. You are expected. Well, not really expected. It would be beneficial if you can train others.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Yeah, and do you like that part of the role?</p>
<p>Wen: I like it for selfish reasons.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Because?</p>
<p>Wen: I train these guys, especially the new generation of engineers. I think it's our responsibility as seniors, to train the new generation.</p>
<p>Jonathon: That doesn't sound selfish, by the way. It sounds admirable, but yeah.</p>
<p>Wen: I just wish someone could do the same for me when I was younger.</p>
<p>Jonathon: Treat others as you would have them treat you?</p>
<p>Wen: Yeah.</p>

<h3>Q4. Jonathon: Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
<p>Wen: I have a peer devops engineer, shes a junior, I work with her all the time. Because she's a junior I train her of course. That's the kind of person I normally work with.
Other would be developers that I work with. They are the main customers for me in my role. I provide buttons to the developers and they give me feedback. If something si not right they will complain and developers
are great complainers.</p>
<p>Jonathon: I know what you mean.</p>
<p>Wen: They are very punctual when it comes to complaining. I've had developers who will send emails ccing in the whole organisation if they don't like something. But that's fine, they are doing me a favour by complaining.
They're telling me that something isn't working as expected.</p>

<h3>Q5. Jonathon: Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. Maybe like managers, scrum master, people in the business.</h3>
<p>Wen: Yeah, sometimes I have to deal with managers. People who might manage the devops team for example. Also Architects. Because they often have a design that we have to comply with. Sometimes I have to ask clarrification questions.
The best thing is to ask the source. So if there's architecture, we look at a diagram and we consult architects.
In general, very often, the architects don't neccisarley know what we need them to, so that's always a challenge. In terms of detail. They just know high level. So we have to fill the gaps.</p>


<h3>Q6. Jonathon: What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
<p>Wen: Sometimes I do interact with external stakeholders. For example, recently I was proposing doing things in a certain way a new way Git OPS. And introducing change is very difficult in a large organization, 
and there's a lot of resistance and all that. Just I mean for this particular initiative that I run, I was required to present to many different stakeholders. So I needed to present the idea to stakeholders like 
head of department, other heads, heads of teams, a different development team. And even to external collegues, as I work for a consultancy. I present to other consultants. So I do alot of presentation. That's normal, I
think, as you progress in your career. What's interesting is, you know, a lot of times the audience expect data. So you can't say things it's good. This is good. This is good. This is fast, but you need to present raw 
data like a graph and you need to show before and after state.</p>


<h3>Q7. Jonathon: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
<p>Wen: Coding.  It’s a good part of the job but troubleshooting is a favorite part. You have to understand the boundary of the problem and use a microscope to analyse the problem.</p>


<h3>Q8. Joanthon: Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
<p>Wen: Dealing with people who do not have the right technical background. Even if you have an IT degree you may not have the appropriate expertise. If we are talking about gitops you need to be close to it.</p>


<h3>Q9. Jonathon: Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
<p>Wen: Australian companies who run applications that they create and deploy, there’s a movement away from VMs to containerisation. That is the paradigm we are moving into. Cloud and containerisation.</p> 


<h3>Q10. Jonathon: What made you choose the field of work you are in?</h3>
<p>Wen: Devops? As a former developer I was always closer to the pipelines and automation. Just got interested in the area. For example, as a java developer things are always the same mostly. There’s more variety in Devops. 
That's why I enjoy it.</p>


<h3>Q11. Jonathon: How easy it is it to pivot to new roles, particularly ones that might be vastly different, within the IT industry?</h3>
<p>Wen: If you think in terms of layers, from physical to application development, then product owner/B.A. there are pathways. As a dev it’s more narrow.
You focus on your laptop. For Devops you need to make it work across different environments.</p>

<h3>Jonathon: Thanks Wen, I apreciate you doing this.</h3>
