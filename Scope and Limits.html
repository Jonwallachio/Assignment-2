<p>


<h3>Scope and Limits</h3> 
<p>The project team utilised the principals of the Minimum Viable Product to help narrow down the scope of our delivery.</p>
<p>From an initial feature list of seven user services, we refined the initial scope of the build to just 2 features.
This was done by identifying the absolute must-have, building block features upon which the rest of the application would be developed.
</p>
<p>In the end, the project team defined the following two features as our MVP:</p>


<h3>Feature 1</h3> 
<h4>Calendar service</h4>
<p>A detailed, comprehensive calendar service, with the ability to schedule activities, block out time and track commitments. The calendar feature will allow users to schedule appointments, commitments and blocks of time to devote to activities. These periods of time will incorporate alarms and notifications services, both push and pull and will incorporate modern UX designs to allow users to navigate easily between options.</p>
<h4>Reason:</h4>
<p>The reason Calendar service was chosen was simple – without it, the rest of the application becomes almost non-functional. It is the bedrock of the build and the initial step which will enable the following features.</p>

<h3>Feature 2</h3> 
<h4>Data based reports supplied on a regular basis</h4>
<p>The application will utilize the historical data available to it and produce regular reports highlighting the user's activities and time management. This will include details such as how much time the user spent on the phone, sending or reading emails, in meetings or appointments, exercising or pursuing fitness goals, at work, with family, in social activities and more. This reporting will enable the user to make smarter decisions about future time management.</p>
<h4>Reason:</h4>
<p>This feature was feasible within a reasonable time frame and would provide immediate benefits to the user, covering the main selling feature of the application – it’s ability to save people time and effort in organising their lives.</p>
