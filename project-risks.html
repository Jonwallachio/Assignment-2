					<h2>Project Risks</h2>
					<p>In this page I have identified some risks our project will inevitably face and the best way in which we can tackle them. Whilst these are all risks that the work/life app will indeed have to consider, I believe most of them can be applied to any Mobile or web application.</p>
					<h2>Too many features in one app?</h2>
					<p>The goal of the work life  balance app is to create a simple all-in-one interface to help the user with  time management. There are a lot of features on offer in this app and this  could cause a multitude of problems:<br>
			        </p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Slow down app speed and  reliability<br>
				      </li>
					  <li>Too many features can make for a confusing interface<br>
				      </li>
					  <li>More resources required when developing<br>
				      </li>
					  <li>features that may be seldom used</li>
                  </ul>
					<p><br>
					  It is important to keep a  clean and simple interface that runs smoothly and offers the end user what they  want. By integrating with other software applications and using permissions  (for example scheduling a meeting in teams), the application shouldn&rsquo;t be too  laggy or unreliable. This should also minimise the need for too many extra  resources or heavier workload whilst in development. The application will also  be consistently updated upon launch in order to improve the interface and take  user feedback into account. If any particular feature is seldom used it could  be changed or removed.</p>
					<h2>OS compatibility</h2>
					<p>Launching an app on both  android and iOS can be a very complex process. It is common for applications to  launch on iOS prior to android as its easier to build compatible interfaces due  to there only being two devices you are building for (iPhone and iPad).   iOS  apps also have a higher ROI than Android apps as the average iOS user doesn&rsquo;t  mind spending more money on applications.<br>
					  Android devices can vary significantly when it comes to things such as DPI and  hardware specs, and developing an app for android first would be much more time  consuming. Developing for Android does have its benefits however, as it offers  much more customisation and tweaking capabilities than iOS.<br>
				    The best pathway for  tackling OS compatibility would be to focus on one OS first, build a fan base  and tweak the project until its in a more complete state and then port it to  the other OS. This is the same path that many other successful applications has  taken in the past.</p>
                  <h2>Security</h2>
                  <p>The work/life balance app collects a lot of user&rsquo;s  personal data, so the security of this data is essential. Should our user&rsquo;s  sensitive data be apprehended it could cause us to lose a lot of - if not all  our user base! Everything the user inputs as well as their geolocation data etc  needs to be encrypted and not stored directly on the phone so that it cannot be  compromised.  A verified SSL certificate is  also essential for any application that is sharing data through the web and can  prevent hackers from attacking or exploiting the application. Server-side  security needs to prevent unauthorised access to personal data and APIs should  be verified so to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

                  <h2>Competitive Market</h2>
                  <p>There are other calendar  applications out there, most of them are much more developed than ours, so how  do we stand out in a competitive market? Its important that we know the answers  to these questions.<br>
                  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What does our userbase  want/need?</strong><br>
                      Our userbase are the most important key to our applications success, it&rsquo;s  important that we listen to their wants and needs<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What are our competitors&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses?</strong><br>
                      studying what else is out there on the market can help us build on and improve  other ideas, and even help us understand our point of difference<br>
                  </li>
                    <li><strong>What makes our application different to others?</strong><br>
                  How do we stand out from our competitors? What do we provide that they don&rsquo;t? </li></ul>
                    <p>In a competitive market  its important that we stay one step ahead of our competition </p>
