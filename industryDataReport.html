                    <h2>GROUP IDEAL JOBS VS JOB DEMAND</h2>
                    <p>The jobs that our group have chosen are as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agile Coach</li>
                            <li>IT Support Officer</li>
                            <li>Penetration Tester</li>
                            <li>Lead Game Developer</li>
                        </ul>
                        An <strong>Agile Coach</strong> is a person who works on the enterprise-level, they assist organisations, 
                        teams and individuals in making significant organisational changes, for the better. When 
                        transitioning into an agile environment it can be a real challenge motivating employees 
                        and guiding the ship towards a complete workplace culture shift. An Agile Coach is someone
                         who can be depended on, and with years of professional experience, to coordinate that 
                         significant organisational change and successfully transition to the new work environment.
                        <br><br>
                         In a constantly changing work environment the ultimate goal of an agile coach is to foster 
                        more effective, transparent and cohesive teams to enable better outcomes for customers. 
                        In order to keep the explosive growth that an agile approach can bring to your business, 
                        it is of utmost importance to have a properly trained and experienced agile coach. The 
                        right coach will quickly accelerate your business to success, whilst having the tools and 
                        abilities to sustain that growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the general duties of an Agile Coach are as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Helping teams analyze data and forecast better</li>
                            <li>Helping a product or service owner to manage customer expectations better</li>
                            <li>Coaching on showing better retrospectives</li>
                            <li>Guiding leadership teams</li>
                            <li>Keeping all parts of the corporation included, including non-IT resources</li>
                            <li>Maintaining a high standard of work</li>
                            <li>Focusing on continuous improvement and development</li>
                            <li>Career development and HR guidance</li>
                        </ul>
                        The closest role to an Agile Coach that is included in the Burning Glass dataset provided would 
                        be a <strong>Solutions Architect</strong>, due to the similarity in job duties and descriptions. According to that 
                        data as of March 2018 solutions architects were the most in demand role in the IT industry, followed 
                        closely by graphics designers and well ahead of roles like software engineers and full-stack developers.
                        <br><br>
                        The role itself will usually find candidates that possess similar qualities, namely business management 
                        and analysis skills, building relationships and scrum experience. In reference to the Burning Glass data, 
                        these skills themselves are not as in demand as programming specialisation, ranking relatively middle 
                        in the pack compared to SQL or Javascript experience. Despite being one of the most in demand jobs in name, 
                        employers tend to value more programming experience.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The three highest ranked specific skills not in my skill set are JAVA, javascript and the more advanced 
                                side of SQL. I have experience with all these languages but I lack practical code writing experience as 
                                my professional career has always been more focused on analysis, management and process rather than coding.</li>
                            <li>The three highest ranked general skills not in my skill set are time management, research and creativity. 
                                I often work on multiple projects or with multiple teams, and managing that can be a challenge in terms of 
                                time management. I'm still working on that aspect of my career. I am always looking to improve my ability to 
                                research the companies I work in, as I often work contract roles in diverse industries. In terms of creativity, 
                                I'd love to develop a better approach to product management to access greater creativity.</li>
                            <li>My idea of an ideal job remains the same.</li>
                        </ul>

                        An <strong>IT Support Officer</strong> provides assistance and guidance to people and organisations in regards to computer software, 
                        hardware, maintenance and troubleshooting. The role itself lends itself to a lot of flexibility, the work life 
                        balance is quite manageable and you donâ€™t necessarily need any formal qualifications to work as one, 
                        although it would help and make you stand out if you did have some sort of formal training.<br><br>
                        The role itself is a sort of blend between customer service and IT and customer focused individuals would really 
                        shine in this type of environment. Many IT support officers possess some of these traits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strong client focus and desire to help</li>
                            <li>Analytical and methodical approach to problem solving</li>
                            <li>Persistent yet patient</li>
                            <li>Good communication skills</li>
                            <li>Extensive knowledge of IT and computer systems</li>
                            <li>Works well in a team or managing one</li>
                            <li>Flexible and quick to adapt</li>
                        </ul>
                        The closest role to an IT Support Officer that is included within the Burning Glass data would be a <strong>Service Desk Analyst</strong>, 
                        due to the similarities in job duties and description. According to the data as of March 2018, it's safe to say this job 
                        is in extremely high demand, close to the third most in demand role in the industry. Once again, this role is well ahead 
                        of what you might conventionally think are high demand roles such as full stack developers or network engineers.<br><br>
                        <strong><i>From Bradley</i></strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The three highest ranked IT specific skills not in my skill set on burning glass are incidentally the top 3 skills 
                                (SQL, JavaScript and JAVA). Whilst I have learned a very basic grasp of some programming over the years (C++, Python, 
                                HTML) these are all areas I expect to work on and improve as I further my studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>The three highest ranked general skills I need to work on are: Teamwork/ Collaboration, planning and Leadership skills. 
                                Given I have been in a working environment over the past 15+ years, I do have some grasp of all these skills to an 
                                extent. However, I feel these are areas I could work on improving considerably.
                            </li>
                            <li>The data provided by burning glass has really highlighted for me the variety of specialised and general skills in 
                                demand in the IT industry. While it may not have completely changed my idea of the ideal job, it has definitely 
                                opened my mind to a lot more possibilities.</li>

                        <br><br>
                        A <strong>Penetration Tester</strong> is a person who assesses the security systems within an organisation, they conduct 
                        tests and purposefully attempt to exploit existing systems and software to detect and correct system weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 
                        This type of role is sometimes referred to as â€˜ethical hacking,â€™ with the professional recording vulnerabilities and creating solutions 
                        to the weaknesses that are found. The typical duties of a penetration tester are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conduct formal testing on computer systems</li>
                            <li>Assess the security of computer software and hardware</li>
                            <li>Conduct security audits and legal cyberattack simulations</li>
                            <li>Design and utilize time sensitive hacking tools to acquire pertinent data</li>
                            <li>Generate tools for breaking through security measures</li>
                            <li>Detect and correct system weaknesses</li>
                            <li>Implement solutions to enhance data security</li>
                            <li>Provide IT support</uli>
                        </ul>
                        There isnâ€™t an appropriate surrogate role to a Penetration tester that is also included within the Burning Glass data, but 
                        appropriate stand ins could be <strong>Ethical Hacker</strong>, <strong>Security Engineer</strong>, <strong>Assurance Validator</strong>
                        or <strong>IT Security Analyst</strong>. The salaries of a role like this seem to range from 70k USD on the low end to over 100K USD on the 
                        higher end. According to industry focused website Computer Science Online, the IT security industry is growing exponentially and quickly 
                        driving the need for encryption, certificate management, firewall infrastructure and anti-malware. These needs within the industry have 
                        fuelled the explosive demand for these kinds of professionals. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for these 
                        kinds of roles should grow by over 30% between the years 2018 and 2028, this is much faster than average growth.<br><br>
                        Some of the main skills needed from Penetration testers are proficiency in several scripting languages, robust creativity and problem-solving 
                        skills as well as extensive knowledge of technical systems and terminology. Luckily for individuals seeking this career path writing, 
                        problem solving and creativity are in demand general skills, and SQL, Js, JAVA are some of the most in demand scripting languages that 
                        a penetration tester would make use of.<br><br>
                        <strong><i>From Callum</i></strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am mostly unfamiliar with SQL, JavaScript, and Java. Though I have done some programming in Java, I couldnâ€™t say I can 
                                adequately make programs with it. I plan to learn as many practical IT skills as I can, but for now I can only program in 
                                Python and am currently learning C.</li>
                            <li>Out of all the general specific skills listed in the Burning Glass data, I would say the 3 highest ranked one not in 
                                my skill set are communication skills, team work/collaboration, and leadership. Rarely in my life have I had the 
                                responsibility of leading a team, or being a part of teams in general. Iâ€™ve never been overly interested in involving 
                                myself in team sports and other group activites and generally prefer to keep to myself to get things done. Whether or 
                                not I end up preferring team work over solo work some day, I do intend on improving these social skills 
                                for the betterment of my career and character, and being part of this team assists me in that.
                            </li>
                            <li>The highest ranked IT job titles havenâ€™t really piqued my interest personally. My ideas of what job I might want to do 
                                have not changed since reading this data, though I am pleased to see that the Front End Developer title is pretty high 
                                up as itâ€™s something that comes to mind when thinking about my career.</li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        A <strong>Lead Game Developer</strong> is responsible for how a game looks and plays, they work with a team to figure out characters, props, environments, 
                        storylines and other game artefacts. They then share those ideas with the rest of the developer team and start ensuring that deadlines 
                        can be met and organisation budgets can be adhered to, they will be the one responsible for any major changes or shifts during development. 
                        In a code development context, game developers will create and maintain the codebase of the game and implement and roll out features from 
                        the design team while incorporating elements like music and art also from their respective design teams. The duties of a Game Developer 
                        typically include, but not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Develop responsive applications for a variety of gaming platforms</li>
                            <li>Utilise current generation game engines</li>
                            <li>Collaborate with design teams to code features</li>
                            <li>Produce prototypes of game elements or ideas</li>
                            <li>Animate characters or objects</li>
                            <li>Troubleshoot and fix bugs</li>
                            <li>Provide code documentation, especially when working collaboratively</li>
                        </ul>
                        According to the Burning Glass data, with the exceptions of .Net and Java Developers, as of March 2018 there isnâ€™t actually that huge of a 
                        demand for game or <strong>software developers</strong>, the market seems to be saturated and there is more developers than are needed in the industry. Some 
                        of the general skillsets developers will have are in demand such as problem solving, collaboration and creativity, what really sets these types 
                        of professionals apart are their specialised skills with languages such as Js, Java, C# and graphic design being highly in demand in the industry. 
                        Programming knowledge is essentially a requirement with many employers requiring employees to attain at least a Bachelor's degree in ComSci or IT.
