		    <h3>What are they?</h3>
		    <p>Raspberry Pi is a series of credit-card-sized, single-board computers. Many
		      operating systems can run on it, including Linux, *BSD, Windows, and Plan 9,
		      but it is intended to be used with Raspberry Pi OS (a Linux distribution).
		      Arduino and ROCK64 are similar lines of products.
		    </p>
		    <p>These single-board computers can have a vast number of uses, including video
		      game emulation, home theatres, network-level ad blockers, security cameras,
		      motion sensors, alarm clocks, robotics, garage door openers, and much, much
		      more. A full list of all possible uses of these devices is too much to type.
		    </p>
		    <p>A big advantage of using and configuring such devices for whatever it is you
		      want to do instead of, for example, buying a set of security cameras that run
		      on a cloud service, or buying a smart TV with built-in home theater software,
		      is that these devices are highly configurable.
		    </p>
		    <p>Let’s take security cameras for example. Buying a set of security cameras
		      that run on the company’s cloud service, from which you would probably have to
		      install a proprietary application to view and download your own footage, could
		      limit you to just that. In some cases, their cameras might contain proprietary
		      firmware which prevents computers and hard drives being hooked up to it and
		      used at your own freedom so that you are forced to use their services. While
		      it is possible to buy a video camera and physically hook it up to your PC,
		      that means wires throughout your house and less portability. With a Raspberry
		      Pi hooked up directly to the camera, footage can be streamed from the
		      Raspberry Pi to your home computer, using absolutely whatever software you
		      want.
		    </p>
		    <p>Another example is home theaters. Many smart TVs come with a software suite
		      that allows the user to conveniently switch between streaming services, news
		      websites/articles, social media sites, etc. This, however, can also be done
		      using a regular non-smart TV and a device like a Raspberry Pi or a ROCK64, for
		      significantly less money. Aside from it being cheaper, it also allows for more
		      configurability. Using a micro-computer installed with any software of your
		      choosing, you are able to decide all the way down to the operating system what
		      you would like your home-made smart TV to do. The issue of privacy also arises
		      here. Smart TV’s most often use proprietary, closed-source software, meaning
		      the source code is not available to the public. This means that the software
		      you’re using could be doing anything with your usage data and personal
		      information without you knowing about it. In fact, Vizio, an electronics
		      company which sells smart TVs, was involved in two class-action lawsuits over
		      their smart TV’s spying on it’s users in 2015.
		    </p>
		    <p>The main reason these devices are so configurable is because most of the
		      software they run is open source and very well documented, which is another
		      advantage of using them. This means that any user is permitted to use, view,
		      edit, and redistribute the software freely. It also means that the world is
		      made aware if said software spies on it’s users. Even if you don’t know how to
		      read the source code, or it’s too much to want to read through, if the
		      software is popular enough, odds are you will know, from the community that
		      uses it or from other sources, if it has any malicious intent.
		    </p>
		    <p>The third big advantage of these devices is the cost. As written in the
		      example on smart TVs, they can be much cheaper than pre-built, pre-configured
		      alternatives. The one disadvantage though, is that they are not easy to use
		      for people who don’t know their way around computers. Without guidance, a user
		      of a Raspberry Pi, a ROCK64, an Arduino, etc. should be at least a little bit
		      tech-savvy and willing to learn and spend time on it, but that’s not to say
		      that only computer experts can use them.
		    </p>
		    <p>Another small device worth tinkering with is a Makey Makey. Makey Makey is an
		      invention kit used for connecting and assigning everyday objects to computer
		      keys. Alligator clips are hooked up to an object (for a bizarre example, a
		      banana), and the other end of the cable is connected to a circuit board via
		      USB. The toy uses closed loop electrical signals to send the computer either a
		      keyboard stroke or a mouse-click signal, depending on the user's choice. So
		      the banana can then be physically pressed to send the chosen keystroke/mouse-
		      click to the computer.
		    </p>
		    <p>Aside from using a banana as a keystroke, Makey Makey’s can actually be
		      useful for a variety of things. For example, a doormat could be hooked up to a
		      Makey Makey which, when someone steps on it, tells a computer (think Raspberry
		      Pi) to start a video using a security camera and stream it on your monitor
		      inside. Or you could hook each of the stairs of a staircase up to a Makey
		      Makey to tell a computer to make a sound through speakers each time a stair is
		      stepped on. Your baby has tumbled down the stairs while you were asleep? No
		      problem, the ‘bruh’ sound effect just echoed throughout the house loudly like
		      12 times, which wakes you up to go and help the baby.
		    </p>
		    <h3>What impact can these devices have on our society?</h3>
		    <p>With more development for open-source projects concerning small single-board
		      computers (SBCs), these devices could serve as an alternative to products like
		      Amazon Echo or Google Home; for some, they already do. It would solve or
		      lessen the issues of privacy and freedom. Having people familiarize themselves
		      with such technologies could also introduce them to or help them get
		      acquainted with using computers and, for some, perhaps even programming.
		    </p>
		    <p>If IT were taught in all schools to all students, even from a young age, this
		      would help educate everyone on how to use technology more safely and
		      responsibly, e.g., knowing who they’re giving their information to and how to
		      ensure the accounts of the services they use are protected in the most secure
		      way they can, but it would also promote technological progress and societal
		      freedom. Information technology is inevitably only going to become more
		      prevalent in our lives, and small, cheap devices like the ROCK64 are a great
		      way to get people more involved in this world of technology. It puts the power
		      of digital making into the hands of people all over the world, and the more
		      people there are who get involved in it, the less we as individuals and as a
		      society have to rely on huge companies (Apple, Google, Amazon, to name a few)
		      to do things for us. This is always a good thing.
		    </p>
		    <p>SBCs and Makey Makeys can be seen as education devices. They are there to
		      help it’s users become more immersed in the workings of computers and what
		      they can be used for. Raspberry Pi OS even comes shipped with Scratch, a
		      visual programming language to teach very young children how to program.
		    </p>
		    <h3>How will this affect me?</h3>
		    <p>I don’t yet own any of these devices, but I would like to. I am already well-
		      acquainted with Linux operating systems and I am currently learning how to
		      program. Being as passionate in information technology as I am, owning
		      something as simple as a ROCKPro64 would change my life. No longer will I have
		      to buy over-priced, single-purposed, non-programmable humidistats and
		      thermostats to monitor and control the humidity and temperature of my indoor
		      garden, nor will I have to spend time guessing and scratching my head at
		      certain symptoms undertaken by my plants and why; I can use a ROCK to monitor
		      and graph the conditions of my greenhouse to more accurately diagnose
		      problems.
		    </p>
		    <p>I plan to move out of my apartment some day and into a house with a yard so I
		      could grow my plants outside, at which point I won’t really need an SBC for
		      said purposes as much. However, I could still use a Makey Makey to alarm me
		      when a pest enters the garden, using some sort of wire surrounding the
		      perimeter. I could also use a surveillance camera hooked up to an SBC to show
		      me exactly what pests have tried to enter my garden. While I’m at it, I may as
		      well hook up an SBC to moisture meters planted in the soil and watering
		      mechanisms to auto-water my plants when needed. The possibilities are endless.
